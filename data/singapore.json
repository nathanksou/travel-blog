  "overviewText": "Singapore is a great mini-getaway layover destination and offers much to explore beyond its numerous shops and restaurants! The weather is hot and humid so expect to get sweaty and dress appropriately. It's easy to get around via public transport or Grab if you're in a hurry. I suggest carrying a bottle of water or another drink (like tea, electrolytes, or soda) that you can easily buy at a convenience store to stay refreshed as you walk around. Additionally, plan your walking routes to include stops at the many malls with air conditioning along the way.\n\nA few of my friendly and easygoing local Singaporean friends would be more than happy to share their recommendations and show you around.",
